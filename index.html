          <h3>Not exactly the model NBA franchise</h3>
          <p>Going into next season, lets take a look at the some of the players on the current roster, and how their contracts line up with the players production.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-7">Given some current contracts, this one isn't TOO bad, but after all the drama from the past year between him and now terminated GM Phil Jackson, he seems to be on his way out.</div>

      <div class="col-sm-2"><button type="button" class="btn btn-danger table-btn">Injury Risk</button></div>
      <div class="col-sm-7">Constantly hurt last year, and little production when healthy, this is easily the worst contract on the team, and was a risk by Jackson that never paid off. </div>

      <div class="col-sm-7">The future cornerstone of the franchise and still on his rookie contract, even the mere consideration of trading him turned the public against Jackson almost completely.</div>

      <div class="col-sm-7">A generaly solid rotation player with adequate production, the contract may sting as he approached his mid 30s towards the end, but given the current market, it's not too bad.</div>
